# Evaluation Report

## **Introduction**

The task involved creating a **data-driven testing framework** using Playwright to validate UI elements dynamically. A **custom fixture** was implemented to handle user authentication, ensuring a consistent starting state for all tests.

---

## **Implementation Details**

### **Custom Fixture**
- A `logIn` fixture was developed to centralize the login logic, automating the authentication process.
- The fixture authenticates the user and makes the logged-in session available to all tests.

### **Data-Driven Testing**
- Test cases are dynamically generated from a JSON configuration file (`data.json`), which includes:
  - **Button Name**: Identifies the UI button to interact with.
  - **Selectors**: Specifies elements to locate and validate.
  - **Validations**: Defines the properties or conditions to check for each element.

### **Validation Types**
- Supported validation types:
  - Text validation.
  - Nested text validation.
  - Tag-based validation.

## **Results**

### **Browers**
- **Chrome**
- **Firefox**
- **Safari**

### **Test Run Summary**
- **Total Test Cases**: 6
- **Passed**: 6
- **Failures**: 0

The tests executed successfully, confirming the frameworkâ€™s accuracy and reliability.

## **Recommendations**

### **1. Enhance Scalability**
- Extend the JSON structure to include environment-specific data for improved flexibility.

### **2. Add Additional Validation Types**
- Support for attribute-based validations (e.g., `aria-label`, `class`) can further improve test coverage.

### **3. Automate Reporting**
- Integrate detailed HTML reports summarizing test results, including screenshots and trace links.

The implemented framework is efficient, modular, and reliable, providing a strong foundation for scalable automated testing using Playwright.
